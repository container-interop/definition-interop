# Container Definitions Interoperability

*definition-interop* tries to identify and standardize features in *container definitions* to achieve
interoperability.

While *container-interop/container-interop* tries to standardize how we fetch entries from containers,
*container-interop/definition-interop* tries to standardize how to describe container entries.

The work done in this project is not officially endorsed by the [PHP-FIG](http://www.php-fig.org/), but it is being
worked on by members of PHP-FIG and other good developers. We adhere to the spirit and ideals of PHP-FIG, and hope
this project will pave the$ way for one or more future PSRs.


## Installation

You can install this package through Composer:

```
